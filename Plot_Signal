% Plot_Signal
% Plots (figure 1) i. a  graph of the unprocessed signal vs time
% Author : Asel Opata
%   ii.(processed signal) after 100 passes vs time
% and (figure 2), three graphs of 
%   i. unprocessed signal
%   ii. signal after one pass
%   i.i.i. signal after three passes

% i.
% Use i-1, i, i+1 to access three points (including endpoints) and run
% through length of entire code

% loop must have the counter to work
for i = 0:100 
    % nested loop running through each individual element of y100 
    % => ytemp
    % ==> builds array for y100 or the first pass 
        % as i goes to 100 number of passes increases by 1 until end
    for j = 2:999;
    ytemp = ThreePointSmooth([y100(j-1),y100(j),y100(j+1)]);
        % ytemp is overwritten every loop
